CODSOFT Internship – Machine Learning Projects
As part of my internship at CODSOFT, I completed three machine learning projects focused on classification and regression problems using real-world datasets. These tasks helped me develop practical skills in data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and visualization using Python and essential ML libraries.

Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction
In this project, I built a classification model to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster, using the well-known Kaggle Titanic dataset.

What I did:

Cleaned and preprocessed the data (handled missing values, encoded categorical features)

Performed exploratory data analysis to identify key factors influencing survival

Trained multiple models including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest

Evaluated models using accuracy, confusion matrix, and cross-validation

This task helped me understand the complete pipeline of a supervised learning classification problem.

Task 2: Credit Card Fraud Detection
This project aimed to detect fraudulent transactions in a highly imbalanced dataset using the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset.

What I did:

Explored and preprocessed the dataset, focusing on class imbalance

Used techniques such as undersampling and SMOTE to balance the data

Trained models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost

Evaluated performance using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC

This task enhanced my ability to handle real-world data challenges and interpret model performance for imbalanced classifications.

Task 3: Movie Rating Prediction
In the final task, I developed a regression model to predict movie ratings based on various input features.

What I did:

Conducted exploratory data analysis and feature engineering

Trained models such as Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor

Visualized the correlation between features and the target variable

Evaluated performance using regression metrics such as RMSE and R² score

This project allowed me to work on numeric prediction and understand regression-based modeling.

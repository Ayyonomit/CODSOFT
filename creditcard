Overview of Credit Card Fraud Detection ModelThis project develops a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using the Kaggle credit card fraud dataset (creditcard.csv). The dataset contains anonymized features (V1-V28), transaction Time, Amount, and a target variable Class (0 for genuine, 1 for fraud). Due to the highly imbalanced nature of the dataset (fraudulent transactions are rare), we preprocess the data, handle class imbalance, train a Random Forest Classifier, and evaluate its performance using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC score. The code is designed to run in Google Colab, includes comprehensive data exploration, preprocessing, and visualizations, and addresses a specific error (ValueError: Input y contains NaN) encountered during SMOTE application. The process is organized into clearly labeled steps with bolded headings for clarity.The final model achieves robust performance on the balanced dataset, with visualizations providing insights into data characteristics, model performance, and feature importance. The model is saved for future use, and the code includes error handling to ensure reliability.

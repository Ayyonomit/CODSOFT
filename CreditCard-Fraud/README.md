Overview of Credit Card Fraud Detection ModelThis project develops a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using the Kaggle credit card fraud dataset (creditcard.csv). The dataset contains anonymized features (V1-V28), transaction Time, Amount, and a target variable Class (0 for genuine, 1 for fraud). Due to the highly imbalanced nature of the dataset (fraudulent transactions are rare), we preprocess the data, handle class imbalance, train a Random Forest Classifier, and evaluate its performance using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC score. The code is designed to run in Google Colab, includes comprehensive data exploration, preprocessing, and visualizations, and addresses a specific error (ValueError: Input y contains NaN) encountered during SMOTE application. The process is organized into clearly labeled steps with bolded headings for clarity.The final model achieves robust performance on the balanced dataset, with visualizations providing insights into data characteristics, model performance, and feature importance. The model is saved for future use, and the code includes error handling to ensure reliability.Explanation of What We DidBelow is a detailed explanation of each step, corresponding to the bolded headings in the provided code, summarizing the actions taken and their purpose.1. Data LoadingAction: Loaded the creditcard.csv dataset using pandas.read_csv() after uploading it to Google Colab via files.upload().
Purpose: Import the dataset, which contains 284,807 transactions with 30 features (V1-V28, Time, Amount) and a binary target Class (0 for genuine, 1 for fraud).
Outcome: The dataset is loaded into a DataFrame (df) for exploration and processing.

2. Data ExplorationAction:Displayed dataset shape, info, and summary statistics using df.shape, df.info(), and df.describe().
Checked for missing values with df.isnull().sum() to diagnose the NaN error in SMOTE.
Analyzed class distribution (df['Class'].value_counts()) in counts and percentages.
Visualized:Class distribution using a bar plot (log scale to highlight imbalance).
Correlation heatmap of features using seaborn.heatmap().
Distributions of Amount and Time using histograms (log scale for Amount due to skewness).

Purpose: Understand the dataset’s structure, identify missing values, assess class imbalance (fraud cases are ~0.17% of the data), and explore feature relationships and distributions to guide preprocessing.
Outcome: Confirmed the dataset’s high imbalance, identified potential NaN issues, and gained insights into feature distributions (e.g., Amount is heavily skewed).

3. Data PreprocessingThis section encompasses all preprocessing steps to prepare the data for modeling, addressing the NaN error and ensuring compatibility with SMOTE and the classifier.3.1. Handle Missing ValuesAction: Checked for NaN values with df.isnull().sum(). Dropped rows with missing values using df.dropna() to resolve the SMOTE error (ValueError: Input y contains NaN). Provided commented-out imputation options (mode for Class, mean for numerical features) as alternatives. Verified no missing values remain.
Purpose: Ensure the dataset is free of NaN values, which caused the SMOTE error, as machine learning algorithms and SMOTE cannot handle missing data.
Outcome: Removed any rows with NaN values, ensuring SMOTE can process the data. The output of df.isnull().sum() confirms no missing values remain.

3.2. Separate Features and TargetAction: Split the dataset into features (X: all columns except Class) and target (y: Class column). Converted y to integer type (y.astype(int)) to ensure compatibility.
Purpose: Prepare the data for modeling by isolating the predictors (X) and the target variable (y). Integer type for y avoids type-related issues in SMOTE and classification.
Outcome: Created X (30 features) and y (binary target) ready for further processing.

3.3. Normalize FeaturesAction: Applied StandardScaler to scale features (V1-V28, Time, Amount) to a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. Converted scaled data back to a DataFrame (X_scaled).
Purpose: Normalize features to ensure consistent scales, as Amount and Time have different ranges than V1-V28, preventing any feature from dominating the model due to scale.
Outcome: All features are standardized, improving model performance and stability.

3.4. Handle Class Imbalance with SMOTEAction: Used SMOTE (imblearn.over_sampling.SMOTE) to oversample the minority class (fraud, Class=1) to balance the dataset. Included error handling (try-except) to catch issues like NaN or infinite values, with diagnostic checks (np.any(np.isnan(X_scaled)), np.any(np.isinf(X_scaled))). Converted resampled data to DataFrame/Series (X_resampled, y_resampled). Visualized and printed the new class distribution.
Purpose: Address the severe class imbalance (fraud cases ~0.17%) by generating synthetic fraud samples, improving the model’s ability to learn from the minority class.
Outcome: Created a balanced dataset with equal numbers of genuine and fraud transactions, confirmed by the class distribution output and visualization.

4. Data SplittingAction: Split the resampled dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets using train_test_split with stratify=y_resampled to maintain class balance. Printed the shapes of X_train, X_test, y_train, and y_test.
Purpose: Create separate datasets for training and evaluating the model, ensuring the class balance from SMOTE is preserved in both sets.
Outcome: Training set (80% of resampled data) and testing set (20%) are ready for model training and evaluation.

5. Model TrainingAction: Trained a Random Forest Classifier (RandomForestClassifier) with 100 trees (n_estimators=100), using random_state=42 for reproducibility and n_jobs=-1 for parallel processing.
Purpose: Build a robust classifier capable of handling the balanced dataset and capturing complex patterns in fraud detection.
Outcome: A trained Random Forest model (rf_model) ready to make predictions.

6. Model PredictionAction: Generated predictions (y_pred) and probability scores (y_pred_proba) for the test set using the trained model.
Purpose: Use the model to classify transactions as genuine or fraudulent and obtain probabilities for performance evaluation.
Outcome: Predictions and probabilities for the test set, enabling evaluation of model performance.

7. Model EvaluationAction:Computed and displayed the confusion matrix to show true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
Visualized the confusion matrix as a heatmap.
Generated a classification report with precision, recall, and F1-score for both classes.
Calculated and displayed the ROC AUC score.
Plotted the ROC curve and precision-recall curve to visualize model performance.

Purpose: Assess the model’s ability to detect fraud (minority class) and genuine transactions, focusing on metrics critical for imbalanced datasets (e.g., recall, F1-score, ROC AUC).
Outcome: Comprehensive evaluation metrics and visualizations, typically showing high precision, recall, and ROC AUC (>0.9) due to the balanced dataset, with graphs illustrating trade-offs between true positives, false positives, precision, and recall.

8. Feature Importance AnalysisAction: Extracted feature importances from the Random Forest model and created a DataFrame. Visualized the top 10 most important features using a bar plot.
Purpose: Identify which features (e.g., V1-V28, Amount, Time) contribute most to fraud detection, providing insights into the model’s decision-making.
Outcome: A ranked list and visualization of feature importances, often showing features like V14, V17, or Amount as highly influential.

9. Model SavingAction: Saved the trained model to a file (enhanced_fraud_detection_model.pkl) using joblib.dump().
Purpose: Store the model for future use, such as deployment or further testing.
Outcome: A saved model file that can be loaded later for predictions.

Addressing the NaN ErrorThe ValueError: Input y contains NaN error during SMOTE application was addressed in the Handle Missing Values step by:Checking for NaN values with df.isnull().sum().
Dropping rows with missing values (df.dropna()), as this is a safe approach for the Kaggle dataset, which typically has no missing values but may have issues in modified versions.
Providing an alternative imputation option (commented) for flexibility.
Verifying no NaN values remain before SMOTE.
Including error handling in the SMOTE step to diagnose any lingering NaN or infinite value issues.

Key Features of the ApproachComprehensive Preprocessing: Handles missing values, normalizes features, and balances classes to ensure robust model training.
Error Handling: Addresses the NaN error and includes checks for data integrity.
Extensive Visualizations: Includes class distribution, correlation heatmap, feature distributions, confusion matrix, ROC curve, precision-recall curve, and feature importance plots for thorough analysis.
Robust Model: Uses Random Forest for its ability to handle complex patterns and balanced data post-SMOTE.
Clear Organization: Bolded headings (**) make the code easy to follow, with each step clearly explained.
